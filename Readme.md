I only finished assignment,add,multiply,subtract,divide and input&output operations. 

In order to test my code do the followings.


$ yalalr

(make-lalrparser)


(target-code-mips "tokens1n" t)


(target-code-mips "tokens2n" t)


copy under "QtSpim target code:" into a file and open it with using qtspim


Also Qtspim target codes can be found in the following files: 


target_tokens1n.s assigns values to variables and does some arithmetic operations and output them.


target_tokens2n.s creates 5 variable and initialize them to 0 and takes input from console then prints them.
